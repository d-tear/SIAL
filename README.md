# SIAL
Simple Image Analysis Library

SIAL is a collection of useful plugins for human assisted image analysis. For many biomedical science labs (we believe the majority of all biomedical science labs), image processing tasks are relatively simple but labour intensive. This is because 1) most biomedical researchers do not obtain the programming skillset to automate their workflows and 2) they also lack the knwokledge to utilize advanced techniques like AI assisted image processing. 

In contrast, most biomedical researchers want to perform simple analyses, like measuring features of a particular region of an image, or scoring phenotypes from a collection of images. Because image processing is commonly just one of the many techniques a researcher will use, it is unlikely that researchers will spend any great deal of time learning bespoke software or even the simplest programming. Unfortunately, with more than just a few images, human asisted analyses can quickly become labour itnensive, hard to record and repoduce, and prone to bias. This problem is confoudned because simple human-assisted image processing makes up the bulk of all image processing in peer reviewed biomedical science.

What researchers require is image processing plugins that will help automate their image analysis while recording all relevant output in sensible and easy to understand format. This is what SIAL aims to acheive. It is a FIJI plugin, containing programs for image randomizaton and blinding, phentoype scoring, and automated ROI recording. SIAL is easily downloaded using the FIJI plugin service, and requires no special installation requirements other than FIJI.
